**Precautions**

> Pro Table has many integrated functions and complex logic, so there are certain performance problems, so you must pay attention to it before developing technology selection.

**Performance bottleneck**

-Multi-field: single-line field 50+ (10 items) affects the first rendering speed, and has little effect
-Large amount of data: The total number of cells in a single rendering exceeds 1000+

**Processing plan**

> Use basic tables or big data tables according to specific scenarios and needs
